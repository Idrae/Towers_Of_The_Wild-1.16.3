Changelog:

2.1.0:

- Fixed the jigsaw pattern registration duplication issue.
- Resolved Minecraft complaining about empty template pools by registering the pools earlier.

Technical Changelog:

- Removed VillageConfig from towers. It is unnecessary.
- Rewrite the registration process basically... It was just not correct.

2.0.1:

- Rebalanced the rarity of the towers.
- Towers now do not spawn in the Nether or the End by default (no need to blacklist these dimensions).
- Top half of derelict towers are now spawning at a height level matching the terrain.
- Added new ocean towers. Rarer than regular towers and have a slightly different chest loot table. Can be disabled in the config file.
- Rebalanced slightly the loot tables. Loot is slightly better on average.
- New config options : rarity of derelict towers, allow towers to spawn in the ocean, rarity of ocean towers.

Technical Changelog:

The mod was almost rewritten from scratch to account for the new structure registration system. Important changes include:

- Different towers (regular, jungle, derelict, etc.) are now considered as different structures
- Towers are now build with jigsaw blocks (just like villages)
